== Introduction

This post is about my experiments using TeamCity's Kotlin DSL after reading the
{uri-kotlin-configuration-scripts}[Kotlin Configuration Scripts] series of posts on the TeamCity blog.
What I wanted to know, is it possible to start a new server and import versioned settings to setup a project with
one or more build configurations.
I also wanted to try using Gradle to resolve the Kotlin DSL dependencies.
My preferred build tool is Gradle and if I add a TeamCity configuration to a project could it be done without
having to add a Maven POM file to the project.

All the code used in this post can be found in the following GitHub repository
{uri-teamcity-settings}[teamcity-settings] under the *basic* branch.

== Project Setup

The initial project setup I used was a Gradle build file using the {uri-gradle-teamcity-plugin}
with an environment configured to use TeamCity 10, this was used for starting and stopping the TeamCity Server and
Build Agent.

After starting the server I created a simple project in TeamCity with no VCS root or build configuration, this was
to get the minimum amount of code as a starting point.
The project settings were downloaded by selecting the *Download settings in Kotlin format* under the Actions drop down
when editing the project.

The settings are saved in a file called `projectSettings.zip`, unpacking this archive gives us the files shown below.

=== Configuring the Maven Repository and Dependencies

After unpacking the `projectSettings.zip` file, the Gradle build file needs to be updated with the dependencies that
will be used to provide type checking and code completion when editing the Kotlin DSL files.
The Maven POM file contains 2 repository configurations one for the JetBrains Maven repository and one for the TeamCity
server the settings were downloaded from.
Only the TeamCity server repository is added, the JetBrains Maven repository and MavenCentral are added by
the {uri-gradle-teamcity-plugin}.

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
repositories {
    maven {
        url 'http://localhost:8111/app/dsl-plugins-repository'
    }
}
----

The Maven POM file contains dependencies to the Kotlin standard library `kotlin-stdlib`, the Kotlin DSL library
`configs-dsl-kotlin` and to a Kotlin DSL plugins POM file `configs-dsl-kotlin-plugins`.
The Kotlin DSL plugin POM file contains dependencies to 20 Kotlin DSL plugin dependencies, Gradle doesn't support
resolving dependencies from a POM type so each dependency was added to the build file. You can see the list of
dependencies {uri-teamcity-settings-basic-deps}[here].

Providing the DSL plugins from the TeamCity server means that the server must be started for either Maven or Gradle to
resolve the dependencies. I don't know why these dependencies are provided by the TeamCity server and not available
from the JetBrains Maven repository but what I have discovered is that the dependencies are generated when the
server is started and removed when the server is shutdown.
They can be found in the TeamCity `temp` directory in a sub-directory with a name starting with `dslPlugins`. In that
directory there are sub-directories for each of the `configs-dsl-kotlin` dependencies and in each directory there
are 2 files `generated-dsl.jar` and `sources.jar`.

=== Configure the main Java Source Set

The next change to enable Gradle to parse the Kotlin DSL code is to apply the `java` plugin and configure the
`main` source set to locate the source in the `.teamcity` directory.

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
sourceSets {
    main {
        java {
            srcDirs = ['.teamcity']
        }
    }
}
----

This really just configures my IDE with the `configs-dsl-kotlin` dependencies in order to parse the code and
provide highlighting and code completion.

== Configuring TeamCity

The project contains the minimum amount of code to setup a project in TeamCity and the next step is to import the
settings into TeamCity.

To import the settings from the {uri-teamcity-settings}[teamcity-settings] project I setup a VCS root in the Root
project and set the *Default branch* field to *refs/heads/basic*.

Using the project I created earlier to generate the initial Kotlin DSL code I selected the *Versioned Settings* page
and selected the option *Synchronization enabled* with the sub-option *use settings from VCS*.

Enabling Versioned Settings Synchronization

Clicking the Apply button TeamCity shows a warning dialog about scrambled passwords being committed to the
version control system, this can be ignored, the project configuration doesn't contain any passwords. Clicking on
the OK button TeamCity then shows the *Existing Project Settings Detected* dialog.

image::/blog/2017/03/versioned-settings-existing-settings-detected.png[Settings Detected, align="center"]

After selecting the *Import settings from VCS* option TeamCity takes a moment to import the settings and configure
the project.

My first attempt resulted in the *Versioned Settings* being disabled, with the option *Use settings from parent project*
being selected.

Disabled Version Settings

image::/blog/2017/03/versioned-settings-disabled.png[Version Settings Disabled, align="center"]

This should be expected, I didn't provide the versioned settings configuration in the `Project.kt` file.
After defining a VCS root for the {uri-teamcity-settings}[teamcity-settings] project and adding a `versionedSettings`
configuration block, shown below, repeating the steps above resulted in the project being configured to use the version
controlled settings.

[source,java]
.Project.kt
----
    vcsRoot(GitVcsRoot({
        uuid = "723408f3-cc0c-42da-b348-dedd4bc030ef"
        extId = "TeamcitySettings"
        name = "teamcity-settings"
        url = "https://github.com/rodm/teamcity-settings"
        branch = "refs/heads/basic"
    }))

    features {
        versionedSettings {
            id = "PROJECT_EXT_1"
            mode = VersionedSettings.Mode.ENABLED
            buildSettingsMode = VersionedSettings.BuildSettingsMode.PREFER_SETTINGS_FROM_VCS
            rootExtId = "TeamcitySettings"
            showChanges = true
            settingsFormat = VersionedSettings.Format.KOTLIN
        }
    }
----

== Setting up a Build

At this point the TeamCity project is using the configuration defined in the VCS repository, so the next step was to
setup a build configuration to checkout and build the {uri-gradle-teamcity-plugin} project.
This project is a Gradle plugin built using the Gradle wrapper, the only requirement is a Java installation.

The following code defines the VCS root to checkout the project, the build step to call Gradle, a configuration
parameter used to define the Gradle tasks to execute and a VCS trigger. By default TeamCity will generate the code
for a build configuration in a separate Kotlin file, I wanted to keep the number of Kotlin files to a minimum so
put the configuration in the `Project.kt` file.

[source,java]
.Project.kt
----
    val buildType = BuildType({
        uuid = "b9b0cbf7-1665-4fe5-a24d-956280379ef0"
        extId = "GradleTeamcityPlugin_Build"
        name = "Build - Java 7"

        vcs {
            root(vcs)
        }

        steps {
            gradle {
                tasks = "%gradle.tasks%"
                useGradleWrapper = true
                gradleWrapperPath = ""
                enableStacktrace = true
            }
        }

        params {
            param("gradle.tasks", "clean build")
        }

        triggers {
            vcs {
            }
        }
    })
----

The complete file can be seen {uri-teamcity-settings-project}[here].

After committing the changes, TeamCity updated the project with the build configuration. However the build configuration
was incomplete, the VCS trigger was missing.

Missing VCS Trigger

image::/blog/2017/03/vcs-trigger-missing.png[Missing VCS Trigger, align="center"]

The problem was a missing import, after adding the following import statement the build configuration was updated and
the VCS trigger appeared.

[source,java]
.Project.kt
----
import jetbrains.buildServer.configs.kotlin.v10.triggers.vcs
----

== Configuration Parameters

One last change I made was to make the version of Java used to run the build configurable by using a
parameter.
The `jdkHome` property was added to the Gradle build step and the parameter defined in the parameters block.

[source,java]
.Project.kt
----
        steps {
            gradle {
                tasks = "%gradle.tasks%"
                useGradleWrapper = true
                gradleWrapperPath = ""
                enableStacktrace = true
                jdkHome = "%java.home%"
            }
        }

        params {
            param("gradle.tasks", "clean build")
            param("java.home", "%java7.home%")
        }
----

Setting it to use another parameter `java7.home` meant that after TeamCity updated the project the build configuration
had no compatible build agents..

image::/blog/2017/03/incompatible-agents.png[Incompatible Agents, align="center"]

To fix this required editing the `buildAgent.properties` file and adding the `java7.home` parameter, after the Build
Agent re-started the build configuration was compatible again.
This highlights that it is useful to have the *Show settings changes in builds* option in *Versioned Settings* enabled
and to check the TeamCity server after configuration changes to ensure builds have not been left unable to run.

== Conclusion

After experimenting for a few days there were some positives and negatives, here is what I liked about using
the Kotlin DSL.

* A newly setup TeamCity server can be bootstrapped by importing one or more projects with build configurations
from settings stored in a VCS repository.
* Committing configuration changes show in the *Change Log* for any affected build configuration, useful when a
build fails and determining if it is due to a configuration change.
* Configuration changes are updated automatically by TeamCity.
* The code for the project and build configuration is easy to read and understand.
* It is possible to create a Gradle build file to support editing the Kotlin DSL files.

And the negatives:

* The initial generated code with the project, vcs settings, and build configurations is spread across multiple
Kotlin files.
* The configuration DSL exposes too much of the implementation language, Kotlin, with each configuration type
being declared using an object expression, an anonymous class, and each file containing a number of import
statements.
* The reason for using Kotlin for the DSL was to provide static type checking of the configuration but, as shown
above with the missing VCS trigger, it doesn't help if the imports are wrong and Kotlin uses another function.
* For the IDE or build tool to resolve the `configs-dsl-kotlin` dependencies requires a running TeamCity server.
* When editing a configuration block I was expecting to see the code completion dialog show fewer functions to make
it easier to write, this didn't appear to happen. For example, code completion shows the subproject function and many
others within the steps block.
* Due to the above much of the example code shown above was created by editing a project using the TeamCity UI
then copying and pasting the required parts.
* Each type in the configuration appears to require a `uuid`, a `extId`, and a `name` property, its not clear what the
significance of the `uuid` is.

Configuring TeamCity using the Kotlin DSL works and is mostly readable but it has a number of problems in the steps
needed to create and maintain the configuration.
I would prefer the configuration to be in a single file, like {uri-travis} or {uri-appveyor}.
I would also like to see if the number of required properties can be reduced, are `uuid` and `extId` needed, or
could they be derived from the `name` property.
Can the dependencies for the Kotlin DSL plugins be published to the JetBrains Maven repository to avoid having
to start a TeamCity server.

I plan to continue experimenting, to create a project with multiple build configurations, to try build templates
and to try the `teamcity-configs` Maven plugin.
